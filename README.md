# Data_mining-LinkedIn_posts
This assignment focuses on LinkedIn post and poster characteristics that may influence the decision of an ordinary LinkedIn user to follow another person (LinkedIn influencer).  The unlabeled data was collected in 2021 and the posts span from one hour to seven years before the data was collected from the LinkedIn site.  This study uses NLP to refine the posts and draw visualizations depicting the most common words used by each LinkedIn user when posting. The posts are also labeled in terms of reaction and comments received, thereby falling into three categories (low, medium, and high) for each class. The cleaned labelled dataset consists of 31996 posts from 69 unique LinkedIn users. The data mining approach used here is KMeans clustering to understand any significant difference between posts that received low, medium, and high reactions and comments.
